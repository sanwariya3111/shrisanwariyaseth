Pritha, the sister of Veer Prithviraja Chauhan, the ruler of Ajmer and Delhi, was married to Rana Samar Singh of Chittor. After marriage, the slaves and the Charan chieftain who came to Chittor with Prtiha were given 12 villages in Jagir by Rana Samar Singh. These villages also included Bhadasoda village</p>
                                    <p>Puraji Bhagat, the very famous householder saint of the Suthar caste, lived in Bhadasoda. Under his direction, these idols were handled and kept safe. An idol was taken to Bhadasoda village, where a temple was constructed by ruler of Bhinder Thikana by instruction of Bhagatji and , the temple of Samwalia ji Was built. The second idol was taken to the village of Mandafia, a temple was constructed there too, which became famous with time. Even today, thousands of travelers from far and wide come to visit every year</p>
                                    <p>The Sanwariya Seth Ji Mandir of Lord Krishna is located on the Chittorgarh-Udaipur Highway, about 40 kilometres from Chittorgarh, in the towns of Bhadsora, Mandaphiya, and Chapar. The deity is also known as Shri Sanwariya Seth and is well-known in Hinduism. Sanwariya Seth Ji Mandir is also known as sanwaliya ji mandir</p>
                                    <p>According to locals, in the year 1840, a milkman named Bholaram Gurjar dreamed of three divine idols buried underground in the Chapar village of Bhadsoda-Bagund; upon excavating the site, three beautiful idols of Lord Krishna were discovered, as revealed in the dream. One of the statues was taken to Mandaphiya, another to Bhadsoda, and the third remained at Chapar, where it was discovered. All three locations were turned into temples. These three temples are all within a 5-kilometre radius of one another. Sanwaliya Ji’s three temples became well-known, and devotees have been flocking to them ever since. Mandaphiya Temple is known as the Sanwaliya Ji Dham among these three temples (abode of Sanwaliya).Mandaphiya, located 40 kilometres from Chittorgarh, the historic city of valour and devotion, is now known as Shri Sanwaliya Dham (the residence of Lord Krishna) and is second only to Shri Nathdwara among Vaishnav sect followers. When people visit Shri Sanwaliya Seth’s Darbar, they believe that all of their wishes are granted.Three statues of Lord Krishna emerged from there in 1840 when he dug the acorn of Acacia that was impeding the construction of a raw road to be torn from Udaipur at the time of the then Mewar state.These statues, according to Kivandati, was invited by Naga monks who were hiding in the ground here for fear of the invaders. In Kalantar, an acacia tree grew. While digging for the tree’s roots, the workers notice the hidden three beautiful avam adorable statues of Mr Sanwaliyaji in the geology. And the locals were overjoyed.</p>
